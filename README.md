**MP3 Tag Editor (ID3v2) Project Overview**  

The MP3 Tag Editor project is a command-line application designed to read, edit, and update metadata tags in MP3 audio files using the ID3v2 standard. ID3v2 tags store essential information about audio files, 
such as the title, artist, album, year, genre, and comments, which are widely used in media players and music libraries for organization and categorization. This project provides functionalities to view the existing 
metadata of an MP3 file and modify specific tag fields efficiently while preserving the integrity of the audio content.  

The core functionalities of the project include reading the ID3v2 header, extracting metadata fields, and enabling modifications to attributes such as the title, artist, album, and other tag elements. When viewing the 
metadata (`-v` flag), the program reads the MP3 file, parses the ID3v2 header, and displays the tag contents in a structured format. During the editing process (`-e` flag), the application identifies the specified tag, 
updates it with new user-provided values, and creates a modified version of the MP3 file while ensuring proper handling of data length, encoding, and header adjustments.  

The project follows a structured approach by utilizing functions to handle file operations, including copying unchanged data from the source MP3 file and writing the modified metadata to a new output file. 
Key functionalities such as reading tag frames, editing tag content, and copying the remaining audio data are implemented with careful consideration of file offsets and tag structure. Proper error handling 
mechanisms are in place to ensure smooth processing, detecting potential issues such as missing tags or incorrect file formats.  

Overall, the MP3 Tag Editor project demonstrates proficiency in handling binary file operations, working with structured data formats, and implementing efficient memory and file management practices. 
This project showcases skills in C programming, file handling, and understanding of multimedia metadata standards, making it a strong example of low-level system programming and real-world application development.
